# crud-app-task

### Technologies used
Frontend - React, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI

Backend - Express.js, Node.js

Database - MongoDB

Tools - Redux, Redux Toolkit

### Description
I have implemented the MERN app as required. All CRUD operations have been implemented. Used tailwindcss and daisyui for styling. Server has been written in express. 

For handling state management in React, I have used Redux. Instead of using Redux Thunk, I have used Redux Toolkit's inbuilt middleware that they provide to handle async requests. I felt like it fit my project better, it is doing the same thing as Redux Thunk but with different syntax. And instead of using axios for querying the server, I have used Redux RTK query. 

### Objectives to be met
1. Use of Redux Toolkit and Redux thunk for state management and querying the server is
advised.
2. Server must be written in Express.
3. MongoDB must be choice of database
4. Use of any other libraries is advised to be kept at minimum although you can use any that you deem necessary.
5. Elaborate designs for UI are not necessary, just functional UI is enough.
6. All CRUD operations are expected to be implemented.
7. Good error handling approaches are welcomed.
